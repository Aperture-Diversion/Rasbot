# Rasbot
Rasbot or RPi2Bot is a completely autonomous Twitter bot doing random stuff all over the place. At the moment, I'm looking into how to give this project another push and start working on it again, let's see how much effort I want to put into this.

I already moved all the outdated crap to the ```outdated``` branch and rewrote them all so that they're more up-to-date and much smoother. The automatic replying-script ```rasbot_reply``` already works much better than before.

### Features:

* Tweeting info about him and the project itself - 3 times a day.

* Tweeting the CPU temperature every 5 hours

* Replies to your tweets with a random, unintelligent answer.

* If you include the keywords "how", "are" and "you" in your tweet, he will tell you how he's feeling at the moment.

Rasbot is made with Twython which is a Python wrapper for the Twitter API, here run by a Raspberry Pi 2.

Rasbot can (potentially) do pretty cool stuff, which does not mean that it's current state allows it to use it's full potential. In this case please look for another bot, Rasbot is still not much smarter than a frog.


**Twython version: 3.6.0**

**Python version: 3.5.3**
