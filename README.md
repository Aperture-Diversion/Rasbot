# Rasbot
Rasbot or RPi2Bot is a completely autonomous Twitter bot doing random stuff all over the place. At the moment, I'm looking into how to give this project another push and start working on it again, let's see how much effort I want to put into this.

I already moved all the outdated crap to the ```outdated``` branch and rewrote them all so that they're more up-to-date and much smoother. The automatic replying-script ```rasbot_reply``` already works much better than before.

You can give it a try and follow me/it/us @RPi2Bot on Twitter. Rasbot will already tweet various stuff during the day, including some info about him and his CPU temp.

You can also tweet him with @RPi2Bot and he'll reply. If you want to know how he's feeling, just be sure to include the words "how", "are" and "you" in your tweet!

Rasbot is made with Twython which is a Python wrapper for the Twitter API, here run by a Raspberry Pi 2.

Rasbot can (potentially) do pretty cool stuff, which does not mean that it's current state allows it to use it's full potential. In this case please look for another bot, Rasbot is still not much smarter than a frog.


**Twython version: 3.6.0**

**Python version: 3.5.3**
