# Rasbot
Rasbot is an intelligent and completely autonomous Twitter bot, tweeting tweets and doing other stuff on Twitter like other people do. It's a computer (a Raspberry Pi 2) that tweets at different times of the day different things.

Rasbot is made with Twython and can do pretty cool things. Twython is a Python wrapper for the Twitter API, which is here run by a Raspberry Pi 2 24/7.
