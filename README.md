# Rasbot
Rasbot or RPi2Bot is a completely autonomous Twitter bot doing random stuff all over the place. At the moment, I'm looking into how to give this project another push and start working on it again, let's see how much effort I want to put into this.

You can give it a try and follow me/it/us @RPi2Bot on Twitter.

Rasbot is made with Twython and can (potentially) do pretty cool stuff, which does not mean that it's current state allows it to use it's full potential. In this case please look for another bot, Rasbot is still as clever as a potato. Twython is a Python wrapper for the Twitter API, which is here run by a Raspberry Pi 2 (not 24/7, more like randomly).
